# Second Brain - Rethinking Notes

ðŸ”¥ Combine knowledge/notes, code, images, any other type of asset. ðŸ’¯

Notes are written in markdown.

* You can use VS Code and [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode)
* You can use a desktop client called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Win/Mac/Linux)
* Or you can use both
* Or you can use neither!

But hey, what if we want some inline code? No problem.

```javascript
// Require the framework and instantiate it
const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true })

// Declare a route
fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
  return { hello: 'world' }
})
```

Our "brain" starts to work like our actual brain (generate a graph with Foam or Obsidian):

Our "brain" is also available everywhere, since we can put it in OneDrive (or other sync client) and have it sync between machines.

> Tip: Use "Always Keep on this Device" in case you go offline. :-)

## Other Contents

Your second brain can also contain **markdown files with code blocks** documenting processes or setup commands. I used to store these in .sh or .bat files, but markdown makes more sense for things that are not explicitly scripts.

Your second brain can contain your task list and daily notes. A great [example of this is here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-i-use-daily-notes/3057).

## The Thalamus

This brain also has a public component. Anything put into the _Public_ folder will automatically be published to the internet.

This script uses the `Public` folder within my second brain, and updates the GitHub repo every 30 minutes with no user interaction.

```batch
  set start_path=%~dp0
  set repo=%userprofile%\src\public-brain

  cd %repo%
  git rm -rf .

  xcopy %start_path%Public %repo%\ /E

  git add .
  git commit -am "Regular auto-commit %date% %time%"
  git push

  cd %start_path%
```

## Next Steps

Set up a GitHub build process that uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build a friendly published version of the public brain.
