## Avoiding Personal Distractions at Work

The new "focus modes" in iOS 15 are a great way to avoid interruptions in your day.

I set the "Work" focus mode, and I only allow messages from my immediately family (wife + kids), and push notifications from a couple of key work apps (authenticator). If another app has a notification that it considers "Time Sensitive", it will still break through. For example, Outlook has meeting notifications as "Time Sensitive" so that you don't miss those.

## Avoiding Work Distractions at "Home"

> Imagine itâ€™s the end of the workday and you have a non-urgent work question to ask a colleague. You know this colleague has already gone home for the day, but you send off an email to them anyway.
>
> Now ask yourself this: Do you expect a response from your colleague right away?
> 
> Probably not. But does your colleague understand that?

In your personal life, you can also utilize a focus mode. For example, you can configure "Personal" during evening hours and weekends so that work notifications are ignored.
